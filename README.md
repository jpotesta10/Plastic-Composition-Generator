# Plastic-Composition-Generator
Describe an object's rheology (how rubbery or stiff).  this program suggests a ratio of poly propelene to poly ethylene to create the object's desired tactile characteristics 

The first step in determing grain size and composition for a 3D printed object is to identify the proper physcial characteristics.

If a desired object should be rugged, a ratio of the polymer, polypropelne to polyehtlyene create the foundation for maximizing a mildly elastic, dense object with a firm touch.  

If an object described by a user is optimally folowing (like a rubbber band), a greater amount of polyethelen grains should be fed to the printer.

Once the grain ratio is determined, a second step in chemical composition can be suggested: elasticizer.  Elastizers are small molecular compounds disbursed between the nieghboring polymer bonds that enable the material to stretch and move more freely.  Generally, this leads to a softer plastic, such as the material you would expect to use for a platic sandwhich baggie. 

fine tuning can further optimize accuracy in material composition rendering in a 3D printing object requirement generator.
